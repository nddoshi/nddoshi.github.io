### About Me

Hi! My name is Neel Doshi, and I'm an Intelligence Community (IC) postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT. 

I am currently working with Professor Alberto Rodriguez on planning and control for contact-rich manipulation. Our goal is to develop algorithms that enable realtime planning of for manipluation primtives (e.g., pushing, pivoting, pulling, etc.) with hybrid mechanics. I am interested in applying these algorithms to several practical manipulation problems, including flexible manufacturing for factory automation and on-orbit robotic assembly and satellite repair.

I completed my doctoral work with Professors Robert Wood and Scott Kuindersma at Harvard University in 2019. My dissertation focused on using optimization to develop physics-based design, planning, and control tools for legged microrobots. These tools were applied to the Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot (HAMR) to improve its performance and execute dynamic behaviors. 

In my (pre-pandemic) spare time, I played volleyball and squash.
