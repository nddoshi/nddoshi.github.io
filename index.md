I am an Intelligence Community (IC) Postdoctoral Fellow working with Professor [Alberto Rodriguez]((http://mcube.mit.edu/)) on planning and control for contact-rich manipulation at MIT. I am interested in applying these algorithms to several practical manipulation problems, including flexible manufacturing for factory automation and on-orbit robotic assembly and satellite repair.

I completed my doctoral work with Professors [Robert Wood](https://www.micro.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Scott Kuindersma](https://agile.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University in 2019. I used optimization to develop physics-based design, planning, and control tools for legged microrobots. These tools were applied to the Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot ([HAMR](https://vimeo.com/274138812)) to improve its performance and execute dynamic behaviors. 

Please email me at <nddoshi (at) mit (dot) edu> if you have any questions.
