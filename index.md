I am postdoctoral researcher working with Professor [Alberto Rodriguez](http://mcube.mit.edu/) at MIT. My current research is foucsed on developing algorithms that leverage trajectory optimization,  control/estimation theory, and mechanics to plan and execute contact-rich robotic manipulations. 
I completed my doctoral work with Professors [Robert Wood](https://www.micro.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Scott Kuindersma](https://agile.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Unversity in 2019. I developed a trajectory optimization based framework to automate the generation of closed-loop locomotion trajectories for computationally limited centimeter-scale legged robots. These tools were applied to the Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot ([HAMR](https://vimeo.com/274138812)) to improve its performance and execute dynamic behaviors, like jumping.

Throughout my career, I have also worked on the modeling, design, and fabrication of robot end-effectors (i.e., hands and feet) that can simplify planning and control and/or be used to achieve novel capabilities (e.g., climbing).
