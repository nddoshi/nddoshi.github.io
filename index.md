I am a postdoctoral researcher working with Professor <a href="http://mcube.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Alberto Rodriguez</a> at MIT. My current research is focused on developing algorithms that leverage trajectory optimization,  control/estimation theory, and mechanics to plan and execute contact-rich robotic manipulations. 
I completed my doctoral work with Professors Robert Wood and Scott Kuindersma at Harvard University in 2019. I developed a trajectory optimization based framework to automate the generation of closed-loop locomotion trajectories for computationally limited centimeter-scale legged robots. These tools were applied to the Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot (<a href="https://vimeo.com/274138812" target="_blank">HAMR</a>) to improve its performance and execute dynamic behaviors, like jumping.

Throughout my career, I have also worked on the modeling, design, and fabrication of robot end-effectors (i.e., hands and feet) that can simplify planning and control and/or be used to achieve novel capabilities (e.g., climbing). Please checkout my <a href="https://nddoshi.github.io/research/" target="_blank">research</a> and email me at <b>nddoshi (at) mit (dot) edu </b> if you have further questions.
