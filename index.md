I am an Intelligence Community (IC) Postdoctoral Fellow funded by the NRO working with Professor [Alberto Rodriguez](http://mcube.mit.edu/) at MIT. My current research is on developing model-based algorithms for planning and control of contact-rich robotic manipulation. I also am interested in designing robot end-effectors (i.e., hands and feet) that can simplify planning and control and/or be used to achieve novel capabilties (e.g., climbing).

I completed my doctoral work with Professors [Robert Wood](https://www.micro.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Scott Kuindersma](https://agile.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Unversity in 2019. I used optimization to develop physics-based design, planning, and control tools for legged microrobots. These tools were applied to the Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot ([HAMR](https://vimeo.com/274138812)) to improve its performance and execute dynamic behaviors.
